## Getting Started

run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## General information

There is no view when select is hidden and box with selected 
value is present.

This was done on purpose to get rid of unnecessary additional 
click to improve UX.

*NOTE:*
*Keyboard arrow selection works only with focus set on component*
